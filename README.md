# Wireless Mic Input

Turn your phone into a wireless microphone that types speech directly into your desktop via `xdotool`.

## Requirements

- Linux desktop with `xdotool` and `xclip` installed
- Node.js 18+
- Self-signed or Let's Encrypt TLS cert (phone browsers require HTTPS for mic access)

```bash
sudo apt install xdotool xclip
```

---

## Quick start (local network)

```bash
# 1. Generate a self-signed cert (first time only)
bash gen-cert.sh

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the server
node server.js
```

Open the URL shown in the TUI on your phone, or scan the QR code.

## Remote access via relay

The relay runs on a VPS and brokers the WebSocket connection so your phone can reach your desktop over the internet.

### 1. Provision a VPS

AWS Lightsail $3.50/month (512MB) is the cheapest option that works well.
Open **port 4001** in the Lightsail firewall (Networking tab).

### 2. Deploy the relay

```bash
# On your VPS (as root)
git clone <this-repo> /tmp/wmic
cd /tmp/wmic/relay
bash deploy.sh
```

`deploy.sh` installs Node, copies files to `/opt/wireless-mic-relay`, generates a self-signed cert (or uses certbot if available), and starts the systemd service.

### 3. Set a relay secret (recommended)

Edit `/etc/systemd/system/wireless-mic-relay.service` on the VPS:

```ini
Environment=RELAY_SECRET=your-strong-secret-here
```

Then reload:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart wireless-mic-relay
```

### 4. Use a real TLS cert (recommended)

```bash
apt install certbot
certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
```

Then in the service file:

```ini
Environment=CERT_DIR=/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com
```

### 5. Connect the desktop to the relay

In the desktop TUI press **Ctrl+E**:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Relay WSS URL | `wss://yourdomain.com:4001` |
| Relay secret | same value as `RELAY_SECRET` on the VPS |
| TLS verify | on (Let's Encrypt) / off (self-signed) |

Press **Enter** to save. The QR code updates automatically — scan it on your phone.

Spoken text is typed immediately, then silently replaced with an AI-improved version in the background.

Press **Ctrl+A** in the TUI:

| Field | Notes |

| Provider | `Ctrl+N` to cycle: `openai`, `anthropic`, `google` |
| API Key | your key for the selected provider |
| Model | leave blank for the default (`gpt-4o-mini` / `claude-3-5-haiku-latest` / `gemini-1.5-flash`) |
| Prompt | customise the rewrite instruction |

The phone's **🤖 AI** button also toggles it on the fly.
